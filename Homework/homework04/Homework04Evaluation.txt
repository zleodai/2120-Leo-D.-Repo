Nice work on this assignment!

Here are a couple of observations and comments:

Nice work making the package mechanism work for this!

Your 'oddEvenTester' works great and you did a good job with annotating the
output so the user can see what's happening.

Your Simon Game works, but isn't quite right.  You should output a series of
letters that builds up over iterations by adding one letter each time, and
displays them to the user.  For example, the game should display "R", then
ask the user for their inpu, reading it all on one line.  The game should
then display "RB" and ask the user again for input, then "RBR" and then
"RBRY" and "RBRYG" and so on, displaying each string and then erasing it and
asking the user for input.  Also, the game should ask the user if they want
to play again when they finally miss a guess.  The "HAHA LOSER" thing *is*
pretty funny, though... I laughed out loud on that one!

Still waiting for Huffman, but you may want to do a cost-benefit analysis on
that to see if it's worth your time to get it working.

progress on the semester so far:

   homework01  100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework02  100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework03  100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework04   92.50% of  5 points =  4.60 points
             total homework points = 19.6 out of 20 =  98.00%
                           which is an A-plus

This one was low because of the missing Huffman program....
