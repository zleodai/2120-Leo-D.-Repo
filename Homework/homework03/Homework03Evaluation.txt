Total points is 35 for Queue, Deque, and Circular x2
 extra credit is 5 points for Josephus
-------------------
 Grand total is 40 points

You got 35 out of 35 which is 100.00% which is an A-plus
===========================================================================
A couple of notes [UPPERCASE for emphasis, not that I'm shouting...]:

First, the book code is in a very bad style.  Please split the code apart
into separate source code files, and name each file with the name of the
class it contains.  BE EXACT: if the class is named "Blah" then the file
should be named "Blah.java".  The exception to this is if you have NESTED
classes in a file, like in our IntLinkedList class.  In this case, you WILL
have multiple classes in a single file, but THE INTERNAL CLASSES ARE PART
OF THE OVERALL CLASS BEING DEFINED.

Second, outputs should ALWAYS include some kind of text to say what is being
tested and what the output is.  Having a line that says:

true

....doesn't tell the user anything.  Having a couple of lines that say:

   Testing the isFull() method on an empty queue:
      expected: false
      actual: false

provides MUCH more information, as you can see.

Third, I realize that there is somewhat of a time crunch for students with
homework assignments, but it is a really REALLY good idea to train yourself
to write LOTS of tests to verify that methods work the way they should.  It
is important to verify they DON'T work the way they SHOULDN'T work as well.
===========================================================================

VERY nice work on this Leo!  I like the way you put the source into its own
package and then wrote the tester for all of it.  That's good thinking for
'reuse' as you are no doubt aware.

Your code is very clean, too.  You could use a few comments sprinkled in, so
as to help those coming after, including a little header block of some kind
which I gave you credit for this time and is there to help bolster points in
case it is needed.... just sayin'

All in all a VERY professional job.

===========================================================================
progress on the semester so far:

   homework01  100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework02  100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework03  100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   quiz01       80.00% of 15 points = 14.40 points
                       total points = 29.40 out of 30 = 98.00%
                           which is an A-plus

Nice job Leo!
